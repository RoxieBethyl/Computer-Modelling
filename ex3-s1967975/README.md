# CompMod Ex3: Time Intergration

The files contained in this folder with their file extentsion are listed below:
- `particle3D.py` (Includes an instance method that initalises the particle properties using the given inputs from one of 4 data files (with file extenstion .dat).)
- `particle3D.html`
- `euler3D.py`
- `euler3D.html`
- `verlet3D.py`
- `verlet3D.html`

Input files:
- `oxygen.dat`
- `nitrogen.dat`
- `spinOxygen.dat`
- `spinNitrogen.dat`

Output files:
- `eulerOut.dat`
- `verletOut.dat`

**Note:**
- The main method within euler.py and verlet.py, when run will ask for a file name. The name of the file to input should be one of the 4 data files, as is, along with the file extention.
- `particle3D.html` is a pydoc file that contains the doucementation for the class created in `particle3D.py`. Doucementation has also been generated for the main simulation files, namely, `euler3D.html` and `verlet3D.html` for `euler3D.py` and `verlet3D.py`, respectively.
- The output files are extra files that been generated through the command line and when the python files are ran.
