# CompMod Ex3: Time Intergration

The files contained in this folder with their file extension are listed below:
- `particle3D.py` (Includes an instance method that initialises the particle properties using the given inputs from one of 4 data files (with file extension .dat).)
- `particle3D.html`
- `euler3D.py`
- `euler3D.html`
- `verlet3D.py`
- `verlet3D.html`

Input files:
- `oxygen.dat`
- `nitrogen.dat`
- `spinOxygen.dat`
- `spinNitrogen.dat`

Output files:
- `eulerOut.dat`
- `verletOut.dat`

**Note:**
- The main method within `euler.py` and `verlet.py`, when run will ask for a file name. The name of the file to input should be one of the 4 data files, as is, along with the file extension.
- `particle3D.html` is a pydoc file that contains the documentation for the class created in `particle3D.py`. Documentation has also been generated for the main simulation files, namely, `euler3D.html` and `verlet3D.html` for `euler3D.py` and `verlet3D.py`, respectively.
- The output files are extra files generated when the python files are run, through the command line.
