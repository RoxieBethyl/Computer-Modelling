# Computer-Modelling

This repository contains the exercises done during this course. Here is a brief description of each:

1. **Exercise 1**: A coding exercise to implement a numerical integration algorithm for solving differential equations.

2. **Exercise 2**: An implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the behavior of a complex system.

3. **Exercise 3**: An implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the behavior of a complex system.

4. **Project**: A simulation of a population dynamics model using agent-based modeling techniques.

**Note:** Code developed in the exercise were used to create file project
