# Computer Modelling

This repository contains the exercises done during this course. Here is a brief description of each:

1. [**Exercise 1**](https://github.com/RoxieBethyl/Computer-Modelling/tree/main/ex1-s1967975): Simple functions are created for this exercise. These are used to manipulate arrays and test vector identities.

2. [**Exercise 2**](https://github.com/RoxieBethyl/Computer-Modelling/tree/main/ex2-s1967975): Builds on functions created in Exercise 1. The class within the script describes point particles in 3D space.

3. [**Exercise 3**](https://github.com/RoxieBethyl/Computer-Modelling/tree/main/ex3-s1967975): Two different time integration methods are explored here,
   - Euler
   - Verlet

4. [**Project**](https://github.com/RoxieBethyl/Computer-Modelling/tree/main/Project%20B%20-%20s1967975): Focuses on particle simulations tests, to understand and analse the behavior of solid and gaseous Argon.

**Note:** Code developed in the exercises was used to create the Project.
